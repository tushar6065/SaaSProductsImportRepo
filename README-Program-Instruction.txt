- What would you have done differently if you had had more time

1. Better handling of exceptions and cases where error is being thrown due to invalid inputs.
2. Cleaner Program.cs file and business logic in Program.cs would have written on a different service.
3. More unit test cases.
4. Better handling of code for accepting commands even after exception is being thrown.
5. Reducing redundant code on SoftwareAdviceService and CapterraService and combining them in a common service.
